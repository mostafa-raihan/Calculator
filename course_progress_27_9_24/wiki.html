        <p><small>Cyberpunk</small> <strong>2077</strong> is a <b>2020</b> action <i>role-playing</i> game <em>developed</em> by CD Projekt Red, and published by CD Projekt, and based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. The plot is set in the fictional metropolis of Night City, California, within the dystopian Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V (voiced by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary who accidentally gets imbued with a cybernetic "bio-chip" containing an engram of legendary rockstar and terrorist Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). As Johnny’s behaviour and memories begin overwriting V’s own, the two must work together to separate from each other and save V's life.</p>

        <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game[1] played from a first-person perspective as V,[2] a mercenary whose voice,[3] face, hairstyle, body type and modifications, background, and clothing are customisable. There are also five attributes (Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical ability, and Cool) that can be customized to suit the player's gameplay style.</p>
        <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in Night City, an American megacity in the Free State of North California which functions as a corporatocracy unaffected by federal or state legislation. The city suffers from rampant gang violence and corporate warfare, exacerbated by an ineffectual and corrupt municipal government and police force. Night City relies on robotic technology for everyday functions such as waste management, building and infrastructure maintenance, and public transportation.[30][31] The city's architecture and fashions are derived from the four aesthetics eras it underwent— Entropism, Kitsch, Neo-Militarism, and Neo-Kitsch.[32] Homelessness and poverty are widespread in the city but does not preclude cybernetic modification for Night City's underclasses, leading to both cosmetic addiction and high levels of violence. Those whose addictions and heavy modifications have rendered them mentally unstable, known as cyberpsychos, are dealt with by the police tactical unit MaxTac.[33][34] Privatized health corporations such as Trauma Team utilize paramilitary doctors for rapid medical services.[35] Due to the constant threat of physical harm, open carry is permitted for all residents of Night City.[36]</p>
        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>The game begins with the selection of one of three lifepaths for the player character V: Nomad, Streetkid, or Corpo. All three lifepaths involve V starting a new life in Night City with local thug Jackie Welles and working together as mercenaries with a netrunner, T-Bug.</p>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>Preliminary work on Cyberpunk 2077 began following the release of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition (2012). CD Projekt Red—CD Projekt's internal development studio—approached Mike Pondsmith, the writer of Cyberpunk and founder of R. Talsorian Games, in early 2012, sending him a copy of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings (2011). Impressed with the studio's unparalleled knowledge of the Cyberpunk universe at the time, Pondsmith and CD Projekt Red reached an agreement to license Cyberpunk's story from the year 2077 onward to CD Projekt Red, while Pondsmith retained the rights for media in the Cyberpunk universe set up until the year 2077. To ensure Cyberpunk's story remained cohesive during development, Pondsmith served as a consultant on Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith's experience at Microsoft developing games such as Crimson Skies (2000) and Blood Wake (2001), and at Monolith Productions developing The Matrix Online (2005), provided valuable wisdom to CD Projekt Red, in comparison to Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski's indifference towards the studio during the development of The Witcher (2007) and The Witcher 2.[37]</p>
